# Fundraiser-Program

Overview: Created a C program to manage and track fundraiser sales for items and group members. The program processes input files and executes user commands for managing sales data.

Features:

Input Handling: Read and validated item and member data from input files, ensuring proper format and unique IDs.

Commands: Supported commands to list items and members, search by substring, record sales, and display top sellers.

Dynamic Data Management: Used resizable arrays for items and members with efficient memory allocation and cleanup.

Sorting and Searching: Implemented sorting with qsort and custom comparison functions, and substring searching using strstr.

Development Highlights:

Modular code structure with separate components for input, data management, and program logic.

Memory management with dynamic allocation and proper cleanup.

Robust error handling for invalid input files and commands.

Build and Testing:

Wrote a Makefile to automate compilation and testing.

Ran test cases and used tools like Valgrind to check for memory errors.

This project provided experience with file parsing, dynamic memory management, and implementing a command-driven program in C.
